// With the new ApolloServer() function, we provide the type definitions and resolvers so they know what our API looks like and how it resolves requests. There are more parameters we could pass in, but these are the two we really need to get started.

//We then connect our Apollo server to our Express.js server. This will create a special /graphql endpoint for the Express.js server that will serve as the main endpoint for accessing the entire API. That's not allâ€”the /graphql endpoint also has a built-in testing tool we can use. Let's check it out!
